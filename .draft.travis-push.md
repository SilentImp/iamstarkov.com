# How to `git push` from Travis CI

Imagine that you have opensource site hosted on github pages…

First of all, you should have cloned repository. Travis CI already did this for
you. But there are some pitfalls. First of all Travis are cloning by `git`
protocol and this protocol only for cloning. Second problem is that Travis CI
have no permissions to push in your repos. Let’s fix it.

## Fixing all the errors!

You already have cloned repo, and the way to clone it one more time (with proper
protocol) is very ugly solution. Truth is near. @TODO link to X-files. There is
much better solution — you can change protocol in the remotes list. Url repo was
cloned usually saving into `origin` remote.

Next problem is that Travis have no permissions to access your repo.
It can be fixed in 2 easy steps: generate GitHub access token and encrypt
it. You should encrypt it, because token gives ability to push anything
with your credentials, without password.

Generate your token in the GitHub settings, in the
_[Personal access tokens][tokens]_ section. You will get token, it will look
like ``
Encrypting part is going to be a bit tricky

> Personal access tokens function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can be used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication.
