# Renaming experience

_4 may 2015_

@todo should be a mem Squatters @ Squatters everewhere

I used to have "@matmuchrapna" username (i know, it’s crap), but from
today you will find me as "@iamstarkov". I successfully renamed myself
on internet and want to share my experience. I’m assuming that you want
the same username on domain, mail, social media and messengers. If you
have trademark, skip entire article.

## Top level domain '.com'

You can get domain *username.com* if it’s available or squatted. In case
of squatting you better to have extra money. If *username.com* is
available, then check username on social media, because it can be
squatted there too.

## Mail (gmail in my case)

You can get username *only if it’s available*. In this case renaming is
registering new account.

## Social media

### Twitter

You can get username *only if it’s available*. Twitter support is
awfull. You will not get any reply from them. Also you will not get
username of suspended user. Twitter will not redirect users from your
previous account to new one.

### GitHub

You can get username *only if it is available or it is activeless user*.
GitHub support is awesome. GitHub will not redirect users from your
previous account to new one, but will do it for repositories. All of the
readme’s badges will be broken.

### npm

@todo dunno, lol

### Stackoverflow

You don’t need to change anything here.

### LinkedIn

LinkedIn is great on renaming, easy and without side-effects.

### Gravatar

Don’t forget about avatar for new email.

## Messengers

### Telegram

You can get username *only if it’s available*.

### Skype

Like gmail — [the only way to be
renamed](http://community.skype.com/t5/Rates-and-subscriptions/Change-Skype-username/td-p/673113)
is to register new username.

## Summary

Define list of social nets and list of username to check. Choose one,
which is available everywhere. Renaming Gmail requiring extra work.
